<p>An exciting and tense full court game to start off the year. Yellows holding on to a slight lead throughout, but the result was always in doubt. A good fun cardio session.</p>

<p>We had 4 a side. Baskets were shared around with all managing to get on scoreboard. Cricketers start at 10 so we finished promptly.</p>

<p>Bob and Richard fed back on their walking basketball "activators" course.</p>
