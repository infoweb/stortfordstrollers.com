<p>It was a tight tussle down at the Birchwood arena before yellows (Mark, Richard and Peter) came out on top of blues (Bryan, Robert, George s/s) 44-40. The lead changed hands a few times, but class won out in the end, not that we are rubbing anyone's nose in it!</p>

<p>We were drilled in the new technique of screening, - thanks Richard and Bryan, and the cumulative finger injuries were discussed. Hope it's not hurting too much Richard. Hope the injuries are healing Keith and Linda?</p>
