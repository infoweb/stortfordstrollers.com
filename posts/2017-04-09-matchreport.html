<p>The birds were singing, the sun was shining, Mark was pivoting, and the baskets were swooshing down at the good old Birchwood arena this morning.</p>

<p>Great turnout - 14 of us. It was hot and sweaty, and much rushing around was done by all. Plenty of physical from returning Helen, and Linda, and calmness under pressure from George (s/s) and George (l/s). Artistry from Bryan, Bob and Richard, and more baskets for Ann. TVR Keith was tearing around as usual with his usual quota of baskets and steals.</p>

<p>Stars of the show, not so long out of school, winning all their 3 games, were youngsters Matt, Tom and Will who clearly have played this game before and just about broke sweat in putting us firmly in our places.</p>
