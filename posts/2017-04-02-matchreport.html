<p>"We are family, I got all my sisters with me...".</p>

<p>So sang a delighted and stubbly Martin, who, (showing his feminine side, not shoulders) led his team of Amazonian warriors to perform well above expectations down at the Birchwood arena this morning.</p>

<p>There were baskets galore as we had 4 teams, and were able to have 2 games going at the same time such is the strength of the squad. Hard to know who was top team as it was close and competitive. Credit to Mark for making this happen and our media and marketing experts for getting the message out there. There were swoops and steals from Linda and Jan and determined bouncing and baskets from Ann. Plenty of energy (especially from Peter who was on a mission!), guile and cunning from everyone else.</p>
