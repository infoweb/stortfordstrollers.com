<p>An excellent game this morning with good passing, moving, and shooting. 10 of us, Blues 29 v 22 Yellows; top scorer, Richard. </p>

<p>And thanks always to Bob and Richard chipping in with basketball tips on tactics and techniques. We have a good balance. And welcome now to new players Dave and Janet.</p>
