<p>Yellows 28 - 26 Blues</p>

<p>It was fast and furious (well, maybe not that fast, or not that furious either!) on the Birchwood court this morning, as a tense and exciting game ended with a narrow Yellow win 28-26. The lead changed hands more than once, but Yellows just edged it.</p>

<p>Aerial power was clearly on display as the six footers dominated the baskets, with slim pickings for us shorties, although we did manage to do our fair share of dodging and weaving.</p>

<p>The standard of play is really improving with clever movement, deceptive passes, and cunning (within the rules) screens. We had 13 players and welcomed debutante Linda, who showed she will be a force to reckon with in the future.</p>
