<p>It was an Easter Sunday showdown. Blues v Yellows!!</p>

<p>In a tough battle, Blues eventually came out on top, despite mighty efforts from the boys and girl in Yellow. There were 9 of us, baskets were shared around, not too many tumbles or fumbles but a few sore digits. Hope the finger is feeling better, Ann?</p>
