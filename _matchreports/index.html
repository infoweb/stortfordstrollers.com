<p>Blues 32 v 30 Yellows</p>

<p>What a great game this morning!</p>

<p>This is what strictly come walking basketball is all about; players tripping over themselves, easy catches being dropped, players falling over for no reason.</p>

<p>A great come back by Blues, inspired by "look into my eyes" Brian, ably supported by long shot George who got his mortar coordinates right this week, and newcomer Vince who used that height advantage to great effect.</p>

<p>We also saw darting runs by Jan with pin point scoring, classy pivoting by Robert and Martin, strong basket work from Mark, but Â shots of the day with backs to the board, were two overhead baskets from Keith and George.</p>
