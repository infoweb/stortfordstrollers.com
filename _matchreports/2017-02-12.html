<p>An excellent session this morning, 5 a side with two subs on a 5 minute rotation. Plenty of skills on display - baskets from outside the key from long shot George, deceptive passes from Bryan, sharp scoring from Jan, solid set up play from Dave, Bob and Richard showing their experience and cunning. Basket of the day from Martin with great pick up and shot.</p>

<p>Welcome to new player Robert who showed he hasn't lost it.</p>

<p>More enquiries about absent players, and the long awaited return of our social secretary. It is time to be sorting our spring social!</p>
