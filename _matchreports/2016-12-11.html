<p>A good session this morning, 7 of us, Yellows 2v1 Blues in quarters, not sure of the points totals, think Pete has an idea. Top scorer; Keith.</p>

<p>There was talk of meeting up/going out for a social once a quarter, so I'm leaving that to the Social Committee!</p>

<p>Last session next week for those that can make it, and then returning on 8/1/2017.</p>
