<p>Yellows 28 - 28 Blues</p>

<p>It was standing room only at the Birchwood arena as controversy raised down following a last gasp long shot basket from........yes, you guessed it, <em>Longshot George</em>!</p>

<p>A shocked Yellow team turned  to see if time was up, and then back to George's  foot position to see if it was a Blue three pointer for victory, or two points to get the draw. With no video referee, it was left to Captain Mark to fairly and sensibly call the pulsating match a 28 -28 draw.</p>

<p>Other highlights included Helen's return from playing tennis elbow, Bob demonstrating how to fall over, and much stravaiging ( a Scottish word used by Bob, which means wandering aimlessly)</p>

<p>A great game, well done everyone!</p>
