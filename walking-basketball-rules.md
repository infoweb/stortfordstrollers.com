## Additions

1. Walking is defined as keeping one foot on the ground at all times when in motion, except when jumping. The official ([World Athletics - Rule 230](https://www.worldathletics.org/download/download?filename=29eea293-b5c1-42a4-9838-bdeaa31d2e48.pdf&urlslug=C2.1%20-%20Technical%20Rules%20(amended%20on%2031%20January%202020))) definition says, _Race Walking is a progression of steps so taken that the walker makes contact with
the ground, so that no visible (to the human eye) loss of contact occurs_. The additional requirement for the knee to be straight is not applied.
	1. Any member of the offensive team deemed to be running will cause the game to be stopped and possession given to the opposing team from the sideline.
	1. Any member of the defensive team deemed to be running will be reprimanded by the court official at the next break in play. Repeated reprimanded may cause the player to be asked to leave the game.
1. Some teams have elected to reframe from jumping in recognition of the low impact ethos of the sport. When in matches, each team can decide for themselves if they wish to adopt this restriction. Jumping by a team who have elected not to allow jumping is not considered a violation.
1. Once the offensive team has lost possession to the defensive team, the newly defensive team must not engage with the newly offensive team until they have passed into the frontcourt within the time specified by Article 28.
1. A Size 6 ball is to be used.
1. A uniform can be as simple as a bib, vest or t-shirt with one dominant colour. Ideally shorts should be of the same colour but that is not a requirement.
